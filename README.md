ContrarianReads is a crowdsourced platform that helps readers explore diverse perspectives through book recommendations. When users input a non-fiction book, the platform generates recommendations for other non-fiction works that present *opposing viewpoints* or alternative arguments. Community members can submit book suggestions and vote on recommendations, helping surface the most relevant counterpoint books for each title.

The platform is designed to combat the ["filter bubble"](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Filter_bubble) effect‚Äîwhere algorithms and personal choices limit exposure to differing viewpoints‚Äîby actively encouraging readers to explore perspectives that challenge their existing beliefs. By facilitating access to well-reasoned opposing arguments, ContrarianReads helps users broaden their intellectual horizons and develop a more nuanced understanding of complex topics.
